# Windows XP Rice
##### Project's goals: 
* Reproduce **Windows XP** interface as close as possible on **Linux**
* Each part of interface (e.g. "start" menu bottom bar..) should run independently one from another with only required to it configs.
* Make it more or less usable and functional (ㆆ_ㆆ)

*This is still work in progress.* Feel free to ask questions :)

* Windows decoration (window title; close, minimize & maximize icons) 
* Better colors match
* Hover effect for 'start' button
* Desktop shortcuts
* Make everything more functional (especially rofi)
